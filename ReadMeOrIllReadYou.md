# Bio-Annihilation II Closed Beta

**DO NOT REDISTRIBUTE THESE FILES WITHOUT MY EXPLICIT PERMISSION. I, SNINCTBUR, AM THE ONLY ONE WHO CAN AUTHORIZE OTHERS TO JOIN THIS BETA.**

**Todo:**
- Optimization (main reason for this beta: fix memory leaks; code cleanup; reduce performance load where possible)
  - Goal: 60 zombies onscreen with at least 60fps (may not be feasible, but a man can dream)
- Fix bugs (fixing the Spaghetti Wrists was a start, but there are definitely more)
- Feature-complete for the time being

**Current big boy bugs:**
- Performance may melt if a zombie can't reach its target (e.g. from the bottom of the flatgrass platform)
- Sometimes after a long time, zombie grab slow stops working

**Less important/more funny, but still want to fix before release:**
- Zombies drown in waist high water (would be a tedious fix)
- Zombies can get stuck if they bump into each other while pacing
- Most physics-based projectile weapons don't collide with zombies
