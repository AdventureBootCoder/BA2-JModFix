# Bio-Annihilation II: Git Edition

https://github.com/Sninctbur/BA2

This is the open-source version of Bio-Annihilation II. It exists primarily to allow developers to easily view its code, contribute changes via pull requests, and beta test new updates before they are released to the Workshop Edition.

It is recommended to use the Workshop Edition for all other purposes, because it receives updates automatically, can be disabled in-game, and can be networked to other players in multiplayer servers.
You can find a link to the Workshop Edition on the GitHub repository, linked above.
